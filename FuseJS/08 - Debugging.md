## Debugging

Debugging of JavaScript in Fuse is currently only supported using Safari and iOS.

- Setup
	- Enable Safari Web Inspector on the device. This is done in the Settings app under `Safari/Advanced/Web Inspector`.
	- Enable the Develop menu in Safari on the host computer. This is done in Safari's `Preferences` menu under `Advanced/Show Develop menu in menu bar`.
- Starting the debugger
	- Build and run your project on the device.
	- Open Safari on the host computer and click the Develop menu in the menu bar. There should be a sub-menu named after your device, where you can click `JSContext`. This will open a Web Inspector instance allowing you to view and debug the JavaScript code of your app.
